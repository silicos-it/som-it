INTRODUCTION AND REQUIREMENTS

General:
========

The following tools are required to compile Som-it:

	- A C++ compiler (like g++) 
	- A makefile system (like GNU make) 

If you want to install globally on your system, you will need root access, and should follow these instructions.


For building under Linux and OS X:
=================================

INSTALL GLOBALLY (YOU NEED ROOT ACCESS)

(1) Open a command window, and decompress the downloaded file with following command:

> tar -xvf som-it-1.0.1.tar.gz

This will create a folder called 'som-it-1.0.1'. 

(2) You now need to configure and compile Som-it:

> cd som-it-1.0.1
> make

(3) If you have root permissions, you can install Som-it globally. As root, run the following command:

> make install
> make clean

Open the file 'som-it.R' with your favorite editor and specify the location of the installed 'som-it' executable.
You can find this location within the 'project.matrix.on.som' function of the 'som-it.R' file.


Specific notes for building under Windows:
==========================================

(1) Install cygwin (http://cygwin.com/install.html) and mingw-make (http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/teaching/fa07-oop/windows-make.html)

(2) Open a command window, and decompress the downloaded file with following command:

> tar -xvf som-it-1.0.1.tar.gz

This will create a folder called 'som-it-1.0.1'. Move into that directory.

(3) With cygwin's g++ as C++ compiler, find the following line in 'Makefile':

CC = /usr/bin/g++

and replace it with:

CC = g++

Then follow the instructions for building under Linux and OS X (from point 2 on).
